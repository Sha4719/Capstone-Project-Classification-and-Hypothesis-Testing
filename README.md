# Predicting Potential Customers

**Course:** Classification and Hypothesis Testing  
**Project Type:** Supervised Machine Learning | Lead Conversion Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting which leads are more likely to convert into paid customers using classification algorithms. By analyzing lead attributes and interaction details, the model helps prioritize high-conversion prospects and enables more effective allocation of marketing resources.

As a data scientist, I built and evaluated classification models to predict conversions, using decision trees and ensemble methods to achieve higher accuracy and interpretability.
